To summarize the XML recording file and assign hierarchical depth values to each <event> tag, I will follow the instructions carefully. The XML file contains four <event> tags, so I will provide four summaries and four depth values. The first event must have a depth of 0, and the sum of all depth values must equal 0. I will also ensure that the default depth of -2 is changed.
1. First Event (Depth = 0): User navigates to the deerhacks directory, runs "yarn dev" to start a Next.js application, stops it with Ctrl+C, then navigates back up to the parent directory. This event is independent of previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
2. Second Event (Depth = 0): User navigates to the deerhacks-backend directory, runs "go build" to build a Go application, attempts to run the application with "go run main.go" but encounters an error about missing .env file, then navigates back to the parent directory. This event is independent of previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
3. Third Event (Depth = 0): User navigates to the deerhacks-cms directory, attempts to run "yarn install" but encounters an error about incompatible Node.js version, then navigates back to the parent directory. This event is independent of previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
4. Fourth Event (Depth = 0): User clones the deerhacks3-bot repository, navigates into it, installs Python dependencies with "pip install -r requirements.txt", attempts to run "python3 app.py" but encounters a KeyError about missing PREFIX environment variable, navigates back to the parent directory, then exits the terminal. This event is independent of the previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
The sum of the depth values (0 + 0 + 0 + 0) equals 0, which satisfies the requirement.
