To summarize the XML recording file and assign hierarchical depth values to each <event> tag, I will follow the instructions carefully. The XML file contains five <event> tags, so I will provide five summaries and five depth values. The first event must have a depth of 0, and the sum of all depth values must equal 0. I will also ensure that the default depth of -2 is changed.
1. First Event (Depth = 0): User initiates SSH connection to server 10.0.7.138. This event is independent of previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
2. Second Event (Depth = -1): User authenticates and logs into the remote machine. This event is a subevent of the first event, as it occurs within the same session, so it gets a depth of -1.
3. Third Event (Depth = 0): User installs asciinema package using sudo apt. This event is independent of previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
4. Fourth Event (Depth = 1): User logs out of the remote SSH session. This event exits the session, so it gets a depth of 1.
5. Fifth Event (Depth = 0): User exits the local terminal session. This event is independent of the previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
The sum of the depth values (0 + (-1) + 0 + 1 + 0) equals 0, which satisfies the requirement.
