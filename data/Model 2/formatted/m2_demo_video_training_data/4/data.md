# Asciinema Recording Documentation

This documentation summarizes the terminal session recorded in the Asciinema format. Each step demonstrates essential file and directory management operations in a Unix-based shell environment. Below is a detailed breakdown of each step.

## Steps in the Recording

1. **Printing Text to the Terminal**  
   Command: `echo "Hello, World!"`  
   Output: `Hello, World!`  
   - This step demonstrates how to use the `echo` command to print text to the terminal.

2. **Listing Directory Contents**  
   Command: `ls`  
   Output: `file1.txt\nfile2.txt\ndirectory1`
   - The `ls` command lists all files and directories in the current working directory.

3. **Changing Directories**  
Command: `cd directory1`  
Output: None  
- Changes the current working directory to `directory1`.

4. **Creating a New Directory**  
Command: `mkdir new_folder`  
Output: None  
- Creates a new directory named `new_folder` in the current working directory.

5. **Creating a New File**  
Command: `touch new_file.txt`  
Output: None  
- Creates an empty file named `new_file.txt`.

6. **Verifying Directory Contents**  
Command: `ls`  
Output: This is a test file.
- The `cat` command prints the contents of `new_file.txt` to the terminal.

9. **Removing a Directory**  
Command: `rm -r new_folder`  
Output: None  
- Deletes the `new_folder` directory and its contents recursively.

10. **Verifying Deletion**  
 Command: `ls`  
 Output:  
 ```
 new_file.txt
 ```
 - Confirms that `new_folder` has been removed, leaving only `new_file.txt`.

11. **Ending the Session**  
 Command: `exit`  
 Output: None  
 - Ends the terminal session.
