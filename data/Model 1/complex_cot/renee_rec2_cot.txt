To summarize the XML recording file and assign hierarchical depth values to each <event> tag, I will follow the instructions carefully. The XML file contains six <event> tags, so I will provide six summaries and six depth values. The first event must have a depth of 0, and the sum of all depth values must equal 0. I will also ensure that the default depth of -2 is changed.
1. First Event (Depth = 0): User connects to bandit12@bandit.labs.overthewire.org, a wargame server for learning security concepts. After authenticating, they view the contents of data.txt file which appears to be in hexdump format, then create a temporary directory using mktemp -d. This event is independent of previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
2. Second Event (Depth = -1): User attempts to move data.txt to their temporary directory but encounters a permission denied error. They navigate between directories trying to resolve the issue. This event is a subevent of the first event, as it occurs within the same session, so it gets a depth of -1.
3. Third Event (Depth = 0): User tries different command approaches, switching from mv to cp to copy the data.txt file to their temporary working directory. This event is independent of previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
4. Fourth Event (Depth = 0): User successfully copies data.txt to their temporary directory and begins analyzing it. They discover it's gzip compressed data and start the decompression process using various command-line tools including reading the gzip manual and using gzip -d to decompress the file. This event is independent of the previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
5. Fifth Event (Depth = 1): User logged out of the bandit SSH session after viewing the password for level 13 at /etc/bandit_pass/bandit13. This event exits the session, so it gets a depth of 1.
6. Sixth Event (Depth = 0): User exited the local terminal session. This event is independent of the previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
The sum of the depth values (0 + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0) equals 0, which satisfies the requirement.
