To summarize the XML recording file and assign hierarchical depth values to each <event> tag, I will follow the instructions carefully. The XML file contains four <event> tags, so I will provide four summaries and four depth values. The first event must have a depth of 0, and the sum of all depth values must equal 0. I will also ensure that the default depth of -2 is changed.
1. First Event (Depth = 0): User connects to remote server via SSH using the command 'ssh 10.0.7.138' and enters password. This event is independent of previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
2. Second Event (Depth = -1): The user changes their password by entering the current password and then setting a new password. This event is a subevent of the first event, as it occurs within the same session, so it gets a depth of -1.
3. Third Event (Depth = 1): User logs out of the SSH session and connection to the remote server is closed. This event exits the session, so it gets a depth of 1.
4. Fourth Event (Depth = 0): The user exits the terminal. This event is independent of the previous events, so it gets a depth of 0.
The sum of the depth values (0 + (-1) + 1 + 0) equals 0, which satisfies the requirement.
