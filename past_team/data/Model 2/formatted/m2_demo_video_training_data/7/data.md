# Asciinema Recording Documentation

This documentation summarizes a terminal session demonstrating basic file management operations, such as creating, editing, copying, renaming, and deleting files, as well as comparing files using the `diff` command. Below is a detailed breakdown of each step.

## Steps in the Recording

1. **Create an Empty File**  
   Command: `touch "file1.txt"`  
   Output: None  
   - The `touch` command creates an empty file named `file1.txt` in the current directory.

2. **Write to the File**  
   Command: `echo "This is the first file" > file1.txt`  
   Output: None  
   - Writes the string "This is the first file" to `file1.txt`.

3. **Display the Contents of the File**  
   Command: `cat file1.txt`  
   Output:  This is the first file
- The `cat` command displays the contents of `file1.txt`.

4. **Create Another Empty File**  
Command: `touch "file2.txt"`  
Output: None  
- Creates an empty file named `file2.txt`.

5. **Write to the Second File**  
Command: `echo "This is the second file" > file2.txt`  
Output: None  
- Writes the string "This is the second file" to `file2.txt`.

6. **Display the Contents of the Second File**  
Command: `cat file2.txt`  
Output:  This is the second file
- The `cat` command displays the contents of `file2.txt`.

7. **Compare Two Files**  
Command: `diff file1.txt file2.txt`  
Output:  `2c2< This is the first file\nThis is the second file`
- The `diff` command compares `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` and shows the differences between them.

8. **Copy a File**  
Command: `cp file1.txt file1_copy.txt`  
Output: None  
- The `cp` command copies `file1.txt` to `file1_copy.txt`.

9. **Display the Contents of the Copied File**  
Command: `cat file1_copy.txt`  
Output: This is the first file

- The `cat` command displays the contents of `file1_copy.txt`, which is a copy of `file1.txt`.

10. **Rename a File**  
 Command: `mv file2.txt "moved_file.txt"`  
 Output: None  
 - The `mv` command renames `file2.txt` to `moved_file.txt`.

11. **List the Directory Contents**  
 Command: `ls`  
 Output:  
 ```
 file1.txt  file1_copy.txt  moved_file.txt
 ```
 - The `ls` command lists the files in the current directory, showing `file1.txt`, `file1_copy.txt`, and `moved_file.txt`.

12. **Delete a File**  
 Command: `rm moved_file.txt`  
 Output: None  
 - The `rm` command deletes `moved_file.txt` from the directory.

13. **List the Directory Again**  
 Command: `ls`  
 Output:  
 ```
 file1.txt  file1_copy.txt
 ```
 - After deleting `moved_file.txt`, the `ls` command shows only `file1.txt` and `file1_copy.txt`.

14. **End the Session**  
 Command: `exit`  
 Output: None  
 - The `exit` command ends the terminal session.
