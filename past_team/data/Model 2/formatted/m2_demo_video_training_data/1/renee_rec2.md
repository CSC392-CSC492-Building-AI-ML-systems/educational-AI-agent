# Asciinema Recording Documentation

## Overview

The provided Asciinema recording captures a user interacting with a remote system via a terminal, executing a series of commands, and progressing through the "Bandit" wargame levels on a remote machine. The user primarily navigates directories, attempts to access restricted files, successfully retrieves passwords, and logs out of the session. The recording highlights a basic sequence of tasks common to file and directory exploration in Unix-like environments.

This documentation provides a detailed breakdown of the actions taken in the session, explaining the commands used, errors encountered, and the final success in retrieving the password for `bandit14`.

## Timeline Breakdown

### 1. **Navigating Directories:**
   - The user begins by navigating between directories with the `cd` command. The goal is likely to find the password files associated with each bandit level in the game.
   - Commands such as `cd /etc/` and `cd /etc/bandit_pass/` are issued to enter the required directories. 
   - `ls` is used to list the files in the current directory, showing the user the contents of `/etc/bandit_pass/`, including files such as `bandit0`, `bandit1`, `bandit2`, etc., which are the passwords for different levels in the game.

### 2. **Viewing Files:**
   - The user attempts to view certain files using the `cat` command. In the case of `cat bandit14`, the user tries to read the contents of a file named `bandit14` found in `/etc/bandit_pass/`.
   - Initially, they encounter a **Permission Denied** error, likely because the file or the directory is restricted and the user does not have the necessary privileges to access it at that moment.
   - At this point, no password can be retrieved due to the lack of permissions.

### 3. **Successful File Access:**
   - The user continues to experiment with the `cat` command and eventually successfully accesses the contents of the file `bandit14` located in `/etc/bandit_pass/`. The password revealed from the `bandit14` file is:
     ```
     3FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn0
     ```
   - The password is necessary for progressing to the next bandit level in the game. This success marks the first major step in the wargame.

### 4. **Session Exit:**
   - After obtaining the password, the user issues the `exit` command to terminate the current session, which closes the SSH connection to the remote server. This action signifies the end of the current session and the successful completion of the task.

## Key Commands and Actions

1. **`cd`** – Change Directory:  
   This command is used to navigate to different directories. It is essential for accessing specific locations in the file system.  
   Example: `cd /etc/bandit_pass/`  
   This command changes the current directory to `/etc/bandit_pass/`, where password files for various Bandit levels are stored.

2. **`ls`** – List:  
   The `ls` command is used to list the contents of the current directory, providing insight into the files available for access.  
   Example: `ls /etc/bandit_pass/`  
   This command lists all files in the directory `/etc/bandit_pass/`, which includes the password files for different levels like `bandit0`, `bandit1`, and so on.

3. **`cat`** – Concatenate (Display Contents of Files):  
   The `cat` command displays the contents of a file. It is used here to attempt to read the contents of the password files.  
   Example: `cat bandit14`  
   This command successfully retrieves the password stored in the `bandit14` file after the user navigates to the appropriate directory.

4. **`exit`** – Close Session:  
   The `exit` command terminates the current session, logging the user out of the remote system. This is the final command in the session.  
   Example: `exit`  
   This command closes the SSH session and ends the current terminal interaction.

## Permissions and Access

- Throughout the session, the user encounters a **Permission Denied** error when attempting to access certain files. This suggests that file permissions or user roles are in place to restrict access to certain parts of the file system, a common feature of secure environments and wargame challenges.
  
- **Access to Passwords:** The user is able to bypass the permission restrictions for specific files, ultimately retrieving the correct password for `bandit14`. This password is critical for moving to the next level in the game.

## Observations and Insights

- **Permissions Management:** The presence of permission-denied errors highlights the importance of file and directory permissions in Unix-like systems. The user must understand how permissions are set and how to navigate around restrictions to retrieve valuable information. The Bandit wargame typically encourages players to familiarize themselves with command-line tools and permissions handling.

- **Command Proficiency:** The user demonstrates proficiency with basic commands (`cd`, `ls`, `cat`, `exit`), showcasing fundamental skills needed to navigate a Linux system. This is a standard procedure for systems administration, file management, and penetration testing activities.

- **Security and Escalation:** The Bandit game is designed to simulate real-world challenges, where users often need to deal with permission issues, escalating their access as they progress. The use of a password retrieval system in this game mimics common real-world tasks of obtaining credentials for access.

## Conclusion

The Asciinema recording serves as a practical example of how a user interacts with a Unix-like system to navigate directories, handle permissions, and retrieve critical information such as passwords. The user successfully retrieves the password for `bandit14`, which is a key step in the Bandit wargame.

This session exemplifies basic terminal operations and troubleshooting of access-related issues, as well as the use of essential Unix commands. The recording also reinforces the importance of understanding file permissions and working within a secure environment where access controls are enforced.

In summary, the user demonstrates how to overcome common permission barriers, access sensitive data, and successfully navigate through the challenges of a security-focused wargame.
