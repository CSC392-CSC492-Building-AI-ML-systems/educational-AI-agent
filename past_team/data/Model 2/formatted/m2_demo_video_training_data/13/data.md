# Asciinema Recording Documentation: File Operations in Arch Linux

This documentation describes a session where the user performs basic file operations in an Arch Linux VM. These operations include installing software, creating and moving files, and verifying the results.

## Steps in the Recording

1. **Connect to Arch Linux VM via SSH**  
   Command: `ssh user@arch-vm`  
   Output:  Welcome to Arch Linux
- The user connects to the Arch Linux virtual machine via SSH.

2. **Check the Kernel Version**  
Command: `uname -r`  
Output:  6.3.1-arch1-1
- The user checks the kernel version of the Arch Linux VM to verify the system environment.

3. **Update System Packages**  
Command: `sudo pacman -Syu`  
Output:  ...updating system...
- The user updates all system packages to the latest versions using the `pacman` package manager.

4. **Install `vim` Text Editor**  
Command: `sudo pacman -S vim`  
Output:  resolving dependencies...
- The user installs the `vim` text editor using `pacman`.

5. **Verify the Installation of `vim`**  
Command: `vim --version`  
Output:  VIM - Vi IMproved 8.2
- The user verifies that `vim` was installed correctly by checking its version.

6. **Create a New Text File**  
Command: `echo "This is a test file" > test.txt`  
Output: None  
- The user creates a new text file named `test.txt` and writes "This is a test file" to it using output redirection.

7. **Verify the Contents of `test.txt`**  
Command: `cat test.txt`  
Output:  This is a test file
- The user displays the contents of `test.txt` to confirm that the text was written correctly.

8. **Move `test.txt` to the Documents Directory**  
Command: `mv test.txt ~/Documents/`  
Output: None  
- The user moves the `test.txt` file to the `Documents` directory.

9. **Verify the Contents of the Current Directory**  
Command: `ls`  
Output: None  
- The user lists the contents of the current directory to verify that `test.txt` was moved.

10. **Verify the Documents Directory**  
 Command: `ls ~/Documents`  
 Output:  
 ```
 test.txt
 ```
 - The user verifies that `test.txt` is now located in the `Documents` directory.

11. **Remove `test.txt` from the Documents Directory**  
 Command: `rm ~/Documents/test.txt`  
 Output: None  
 - The user removes `test.txt` from the `Documents` directory.

12. **Verify the Documents Directory After Deletion**  
 Command: `ls ~/Documents`  
 Output: None  
 - The user confirms that `test.txt` has been removed from the `Documents` directory.

13. **Exit the SSH Session**  
 Command: `exit`  
 Output: None  
 - The user exits the SSH session after completing the file operations.
